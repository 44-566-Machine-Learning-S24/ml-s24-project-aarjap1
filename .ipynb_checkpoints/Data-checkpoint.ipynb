The dataset had a total of 8 features with 1000 entries. Out of the 8 feature 6 of them were non-numeric and 3 were numeric. So most of the features required converting to numeric type which included parental level of education, gender and race. The numeric features were the Math, Reading and Writing score which I combined to created a new feature called Total Score."
